### LEMNİSCATE PATH FOR UAV  ###
This program was created for special mission for fixed-wing UAV. During autonomous flight, the UAV is able to determine needed locations of the lemniscate path according to departure position. By doing required calculations for coordinate conversions, the plane can fly without dependency of any information about what direction it should fly. This information is provided from itself by using the heading degree. The plane always draws the lemniscate pattern at the left side of the where the plane noise points.
